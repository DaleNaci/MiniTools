<h1>MiniTools</h1>
<p>Programs written by me to make certain tasks more convenient.</p>

<h3>Alphabetizer</h3>
<p>This takes a text file as an input and sorts it alphabetically based on the beginning of each line.</p>

<h3>Auto Confirmer</h3>
<p>For games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive and League of Legends, after queuing for a game, you have to click an accept button to show that you are not AFK. This program can automatically click the accept button for you.</p>

<h3>Caesar Decipher</h3>
<p>This project is the very first project to hit 'MiniTools' with a simple idea to make CTFs a bit more automated. The program takes an encoded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> message and decodes it.</p>

<h3>Dice Roller</h3>
<p>This program can roll any type and number of dice, and add them all together. This is extremely useful, specifically for games such as Dungeons & Dragons, where you need an abundant quantity of dice in order to play. All of those dice can be replaced by this simple program.</p>

<h3>MEE6 Leveler</h3>
<p>The MEE6 Discord bot gives you exp for every message you send but with a minute-long cooldown. This code will send a message in a Discord text channel every 61 seconds.</p>

<h3>Prime Number Generator</h3>
<p>Enter a number, and it will return all prime numbers leading up to that number.</p>

<h3>Registration Loader</h3>
<p>To get a faster registration, this bot automatically reloads the registration page for NJIT. This will ensure that I get the best options for picking my classes.</p>

<h3>Statistics Calculator</h3>
<p>Basic parser that takes in a comma+space separated string input and returns the mean and standard deviation of the numbers. Used for my statistics class (MATH 333).</p>
