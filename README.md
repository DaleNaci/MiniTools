<h1>MiniTools</h1>
<p>Programs written by me to make certain tasks more convenient.</p>

<h3>Caesar Decipher</h3>
<p>This project is the very first project to hit 'MiniTools' with a simple idea to make CTFs a bit more automated. The program takes an encoded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> message and decodes it.</p>

<h3>Dice Roller</h3>
<p>This program can roll any type and number of dice, and add them all together. This is extremely useful, specifically for games such as Dungeons & Dragons, where you need an abundant quantity of dice in order to play. All of those dice can be replaced by this simple program.

<h3>Prime Number Generator</h3>
<p>Enter a number, and it will return all prime numbers leading up to that number.</p>
